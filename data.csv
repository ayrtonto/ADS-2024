Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano",en,Pop,fear,0.979992092

""Tu sens l'esprit adolescent""
In August of 1990, Kurt Cobain and Kathleen Hanna (of Bikini Kill) were hanging out on a hill near a teen pregnancy center in Olympia. The clinic, instead of providing abortions to expecting teenagers, was actually an pro-life center that encouraged girls to keep their babies, claiming they'd end up in hell otherwise.
Kathleen explains:Since Kurt and I were angry young feminists in the nineties, we decided that we were going to do a little public service that night. We drank our Canadian Club, and he watched out while I went across the street and wrote ""Fake Abortion Clinic Everyone"". I was kinda the pragmatic one and he was more creative so he went over and in 6 foot tall red letters wrote ""God Is King.""
Later that night, drunk out of their minds, the two returned to Kurt's motel, and while Kurt was sleeping, Kathleen grabbed a Sharpie marker and wrote ""Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit"" all over the wall. This was a reference to Tobi Vail (drummer of Bikini Kill) who Kurt dated and used to wear Teen Spirit deodorant. Kathleen was implying that Tobi had marked Kurt with her scent.",en,Grunge,sadness,0.999871969

57,Leonard Cohen,Songs Of Leonard Cohen,1967,Master Song,2,"I believe that you heard your master sing
When I was sick in bed.
I suppose that he told you everything
That I keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
Well at least that's what you said.
And now do you come back to bring
Your prisoner wine and bread?
You met him at some temple, where
They take your clothes at the door.
He was just a numberless man in a chair
Who'd just come back from the war.
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
And he hands you the apple core.
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
Of all the kisses we put on some time before.
And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
With a collar of leather and nails,
And he never once made you explain or talk
About all of the little details,
Such as who had a word and who had a rock,
And who had you through the mails.
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
And it never stops not even when your master fails.
And he took you up in his aeroplane,
Which he flew without any hands,
And you cruised above the ribbons of rain
That drove the crowd from the stands.
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
And, an ape with angel glands,
Erased the final wisps of pain
With the music of rubber bands.
And now I hear your master sing,
You kneel for him to come.
His body is a golden string
That your body is hanging from.
His body is a golden string,
My body has grown numb.
Oh now you hear your master sing,
Your shirt is all undone.
And will you kneel beside this bed
That we polished so long ago,
Before your master chose instead
To make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
And you're speaking far too low.
No I can't make out what your master said
Before he made you go.
Then I think you're playing far too rough
For a lady who's been to the moon;
I've lain by this window long enough
To get used to an empty room.
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
Who is tapping his foot to a tune,
And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
Let's say you came back some time too soon.
I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.
He was starving in some deep mystery
Like a man who is sure what is true.
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,
And I taught him how you would long for me
No matter what he said no matter what you'd do.
I believe that you heard your master sing
While I was sick in bed,
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head.

""I wrote it (Landslide) for Lindsey - for him, about him. It's dear to both of us because it's about us. We're out there singing about our lives.""
""It was written in 1973 at a point where Lindsey and I had driven to Aspen for him to rehearse for two weeks with Don Everly. Lindsey was going to take Phil's place. So they rehearsed and left, and I made a choice to stay in Aspen. I figured I'd stay there and one of my girlfriends was there. We stayed there for almost three months while Lindsey was on the road, and this is right after the Buckingham Nicks record had been dropped. And it was horrifying to Lindsey and I because we had a taste of the big time, we recorded in a big studio, we met famous people, we made what we consider to be a brilliant record and nobody liked it (laughs). I had been a waitress and a cleaning lady, and I didn't mind any of this. I was perfectly delighted to work and support us so that Lindsey could produce and work and fix our songs and make our music.
But I had gotten to a point where it was like, ""I'm not happy. I am tired. But I don't know if we can do any better than this. If nobody likes this, then what are we going to do?""
So during that two months I made a decision to continue. ""Landslide"" was the decision. (Sings) ""When you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills"" - it's the only time in my life that I've lived in the snow. But looking up at those Rocky Mountains and going, ""Okay, we can do it. I'm sure we can do it."" In one of my journal entries, it says, ""I took Lindsey and said, 'We're going to the top!'"" And that's what we did. Within a year, Mick Fleetwood called us, and we were in Fleetwood Mac making $800 a week apiece (laughs). It was hysterical. It was like we were rich overnight.
""It's about a father-daughter relationship""
Landslide was written the night before her dad was operated on at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota in 1974
""I realized then that everything could tumble, and when you're in Colorado, and you're surrounded by these incredible mountains, you think avalanche. It meant the whole world could tumble around us and the landslide would bring you down. And a landslide in the snow is like, deadly. And when you're in that kind of a snow-covered, surrounding place, you don't just go out and yell, because the whole mountain could come down on you.
Landslide I wrote on the guitar, and it's another one that I wrote in about five minutes. But see, when I'm really thinking about something ~ I mean when something's really bothering me ~ again, the best thing that I can do is go to the music room, or to the office, where I can write. Because once I put it down and I can read it back, and I can think about what I'm saying, then it makes sense to me. When I'm just thinking it in my head, it's going around and around, and I feel like a little child unable to make a real, substantial decision. And we were talking about our lives... the rest of our lives.""",en,Rock,love,0.994861782

Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out ?
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine
I didn't think much about it
Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen that night
I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again
[Chorus]
They say the time is a healer
And new my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straght in the eyes
He said :
You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine
Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
As the time, it went by, I lived to regret it
You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go, ?
And what should I do ?
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you
Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away
In and out of hiding places ?
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over

Only had CD's
Digitally clean,
It was a piece of crap
Piece of crap !
Bought myself a car,
Thought it'd take me far
The dealer was a liar,
He was a piece of crap...
Piece of crap !
I tried to plug in it
I tried to turn it on
When I got it home
It was a piece of crap
Piece of crap !
Got it from a friend
On him you can depend
I found out in the end
It was a piece of crap
Piece of crap !
I'm trying to save the trees
I saw it on tv
They cut the forest down
To build a piece of crap
Piece of crap !
Picked up a magazine 
To read about the scene
It didn't tell me beans, 
It was a piece of crap
Piece of crap !
I went back to the store
They gave me four more
The guy told me at the door
It's a piece of crap

If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give
(Chorus:)Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me party lies
All I want is someone to believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me where else can I turn
Cause you're the one that I depend upon

Already caught in a trap
His angel's kiss was a joke
And she is not coming back

Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free

Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now

He's got a reason to pray
His life is under the gun
He's got to hold every day

Cause in your sleep you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then cause the rain began

That I wont hold your hand
But if it helps you man
Then I wont stop it

Was like a cold dark cloud

What’s gonna happen today

And stop raising your voice

It's a simple suggestion can you give me some time
So just say yes or no
Why can't you shoulder the blame
Cause both my shoulders are heavy
From the weight of us both

Who became my friend,
And behind your back she trying to get in my bed

Cause if I did I wouldn't be no better than your friend

So many times you think I was lying

And how she want to be creeping

Why she keep telling me my style she be feeling ?
Why she keep telling me that she don't mind creeping ?
Why she keep telling me in my bed she wanna sleep in ?

Hiding somewhere in the night

Is swept around in motion

In motion on the ocean

The waves still keep on waving

The life that is to be mine
And would they let their light shine
Enough for me to follow
I look up to the heavens
But night has clouded over
No spark of constellation
No Vela no Orion
The shells upon the warm sands
Have taken from their own lands
The echo of their story
But all I hear are low sounds
As pillow words are weaving
And willow waves are leaving
But should I be believing
That I am only dreaming

To leave the thread of all time
And let it make a dark line
In hopes that I can still find
The way back to the moment

Begin a new beginning
Still looking for the answer
I cannot find the finish

It's one way or the other

I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo)
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

Gorillaz beat on they chest when
Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us
The spirit of Bugz is still in me
God bless it the trinity
Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's
Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze
So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night and day
Right away blow your life away, so light your haze
Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed
Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage
The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged

Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby
And I ain't never going home, Bizarre can for go
It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong
As I sit in my seat and remain calm
And close my eyes and wait for the bomb (here it comes ! )

It's hectic with some bullshit that happen
You least expected
We just don't accept it nigga
I go ahead, lift my trigger
Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit

You don't need us to say the world is fucked up dawgs can see it

Is it money or God
Betray your trust, sustain your vows
Secretly or sacred

Move your body-body
Rip up on the Bacardi

To fade away

On a dead end street

I just can't keep

Read 'em and weep
And the dawn don't rescue me

Down dust and pine cone tracks
We slept like dogs down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog all around us 
The boom of summer time

Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
As the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning.
Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags,
I've come to know the friends around you
Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, or the echoed stone 
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls now
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones

You know my friend there's nothing that you can really do
Just follow on behind her veil of deepest purple haze
Down, to love's strange ways
Drowning in a laughter as you go
Intoxicating laughter that spins you high and low
Dangerous times are these, but oh so wonderfully new
Laugh along you fool, can't see they're laughing at you
Lost in the haze
Of love's strange ways

Just a passion and a fool

But this kid Drag strike a light
Fuck five mics, my fire burn the wire
Cause we the niggas that plug, wrap 'em in the rug
Flames mini blowin on my hands like dust
Chicks wanna slurp? I guarantee I'll make ya burp
Just push yo' teeth to the curb and hum a word
Some nerve, cats think they can touch a torch
You don't know I buy my gun just for me to toss
Fuck what it costs, I don't care what kind of drop you pushin
I put my fifteen to your top and dump bullets
Yeah I see y'all cowards like to wear vests
Well I'ma aim a little higher, like for your neck
I puff lye, I'ma lift blunts til my arm look like Popeye
Til the day is bye-bye
Til then 300G fly by, rented
So foggy windows look tinted
We just be lookin at your Roley at dem hot shows
So go 'head boy, get drunk, pop that Mo'
Until I pull ya to the side, see the nine kid?
And since you got that nice watch, you know what time it is
Cause Drag's clock say 7:30
So sudden move and you gon' be left somewhere real dirty, dirty
Double R, a camp where it's all champs
And if y'all want to stop fire, open up a damn
(Repeat 1)
Bet'cha niggas wonder
Why Drag always spit fire? Why I always pop shit?
About how I burn niggas til they chocolate
Cause I'm the +Opposite of H2O+ now ya know
Fix your wrinkled face - my iron press more than clothes
And girls - I love 'em when I meet 'em, might eat 'em
But when they act up, it's like Turner... Tina
Don't me get the burner
Catch me in the low key Pontiac Sun sippin Con-gac
Y'all know how that affects blacks, so you know I clash that
No way I'ma blow all these gats and crack stacks
I'ma lil' nigga so you know I run fast
But don't do much of it do a lot of gun bustin
Cause when I let off a clip, I get a kick
Outta seeing niggas run - eyes open, hopin they don't trip
Hear the echoes blocks away
Type of bricklayers that hear shots today and give your blocks away
Run up on papi - hey! Drop the yay
And if he don't stall this world be popped tomorrow
Drag-On speaks with a stutter, but I rhyme well
So like a dead snitch it's hard to tell

This is to my grimy grimy, niggas - word
This is to my RR, niggas - word

Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"", came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip""
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death
There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip

In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn’t it be lovely

When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I’d been napping
And I’d just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to 8 shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones wave and breathe
Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the trees
And stars were still illumated
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nightime reelings
And some absynthe drunk so late
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I’m happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I’m just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight
Straight up to illusion and fantasy’s fusion
Of reality mixed with drink

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah !
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
No, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo

Prayers they hide the saddest view

And your prayers they break the sky in two

Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

Or from a park bench

And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet

Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
'Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
Here's a one of a kind

1739,Passenger,Songs for the Drunk and Broken Hearted,2021,A Song For The Drunk And Broken Hearted,4,"Sweet Sunday afternoon, September's golden brown
Summer always fades too soon like the laughter of a clown
Shadows fill the room where sorrows come to drown
Your heart’s a late bloom as you sink another one down
I know it knows the way you feel
Blurs what is right and what is real
There's no love left you could steal
(Chorus:)For the joker laughs alone
And the jester's outsmarted
And the gambler tries to win back what he’s lost
And the sad mind sings a song
For the drunk and broken-hearted
And the fool, he never knows how much it cost
The sweet Sunday afternoon and all that can be heard
Is an old, familiar tune for you've forgotten half the words
The sunlight floods the room like a silent flock of birds
And hopes a red bloom, disappearing through the clouds
I know it knows the way you feel
Blurs what is right and what is real
And there's no one here to make a deal with
(Chorus)
(Instru)
(Chorus:)Yeah the joker laughs alone
And the jester's outsmarted
And the gambler tries to win back what he’s lost
Oh, and the sad mind, he, sings a song
For the drunk and broken-hearted
Oh, and the fool, he never knows how much it cost

The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs, natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there's no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she
(Chorus)
I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question, what are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or ass
I'm well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio and Cris with some lime what is this?
An immaculate version of Me and My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me
(Chorus)
Yeah, yeah, let's pour some cherry wine
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, ayo Salaam, yeah, I think they know the time
Everything's good, everything's fine

Talking at her with a different voice

Can't remember what she came here for
Couldn't keep her promise
Not to gaze at things she can't afford
Cuz there's shoes, bags and silk scarves
And dreams of summer days
And now she's wording a letter to her bosses
For a raise...
But then she passes the baby section
With the tinest shoes on shiny trays

Going to the store and make a choice
But everything she sees, it's like they're talking
Talking at her with a different voice

And the voice of countless charities
But the one she heeds with certainty says
Have it all, have it all, have it all

Gazing at their suits and her shoulders still no man
And it's another year of winter holidays
But soon she'll have him, and buy him
They'll sit like this and they'll go skiing every year
He's around the corner, the man who'll love her
And understand her and her career

Deep into the great vana-fyrdbattle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground.

Höne could not rule.In a fit of violent rage,Mímir's blood was shedand to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head.
Truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained.Njord and Frey to Asgard cameand Hön' and Mim to Vanaheim
Death, see the furious gods wanting blood,Odin knew that a raging warwould not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain.

Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care but I aint get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but its like we both blind
Fuck it lets hit the club, i rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when its all said and done,
I aint gon be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love Im tired of tryin
My heart big but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin
Cause every time we alone its a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, whatchu trippin for ?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think its better if I let you know

Im on some new shit
Im chuckin my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her 

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we aint got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick Im with never complain
She make wanna leave the one im with Usher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will.
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she aint you
She Paula Patton thick, She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don't care bout it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But im just puttin two up, chuckin up the deuce now

Im on some new shit

Open up the doors on 'em, we playin' tonight
Bring on the marchin' band and turn on the stadium lights
They gon' learn from me, this is our church to be
Life of a champion, ugh, so Freddie Mercury
Sneakin' into Hov concerts in nosebleeds

Victory in my grasp, gotta fight for this
The streets are ours this evening, goin' undefeated
I roll the dice against the staircase, uh huh
Steak season gotta marinate, uh huh
If I happen to die tonight, put my spirit in the stars
Bury me in the grave and carve ""The history was ours""Said I—

We ain't cut from the same cloth, player
Talkin' to a boss player
Checks like a ball player
Easy money, all layups

Get up off my dick and get the finger like a cross-fader
I be in my lawn chair, star gazin' like, woo!All praise to the most high
Your boy in his own J's, I made it to courtside
Remember the old days and playin' for co-signs
When labels offer me pay, I said that I won't sign
I took my weakness and turned that into a weapon
And when everybody doubted me, I turned that to my leverage
So I stand up on the stage, it wasn't planned, see it was destined
Look at fifty-thousand people with their hands into the heavens
Said I—

Won't let death make a move
Might not mean much to you, but I'd die for this WLet my life be something to prove
Every scrape, every fight, every cut, every bruise
I'll lay it all on the line, I'll re-write these rules
Victory in my sight, I will not lose

It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty, delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered at the back door, ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""
Then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today Billie Joe Mc
Allister jumped off the Tallahatchee Bridge""
Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick o' sense, pass the biscuits, please
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was a shame about Billie Joe anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe Mc
Allister's jumped off the Tallahatchee Bridge
Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchee Bridge
Mama said to me, ""Child what's happened to your appetite ?
I been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched single bite
That nice young preacher Brother Taylor dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchee Bridge""

There was a virus goin' round, papa caught it and he died last spring

I was sat there in my flat, on my own, I hadn’t been out or seen anyone in days: I was trying to write lyrics and melodies, but I was off my trolly that I couldn’t, and suddenly the sheer soul-destroying loneliness of where I was in my own head made something click…”
“The sweetness of Stillness In Time was really wishful thinking: a hope that things would get better. Like a lot of tracks on this album, I was writing it for my own self-healing. It was always ‘we’ not ‘me’, I was telling myself that we could do this. I realised that I was getting myself in a lot of trouble, and if I wasn’t careful I was going to throw it all away before I’d even started, and that was fucking terrifying.”",en,Rock,joy,0.99926132

No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin’ in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hidin’ from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wonderin’ if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious
Socrates asks, “Whose bias do y’all seek?”
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here ballin’, I know y’all hear my sneaks

Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission’
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit’out tellin’ me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin’ up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin’ ’bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin’ the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read “No Apologies”
The other said “Love is cursed by monogamy”
That’s somethin’ that the pastor don’t preach
That’s somethin’ that a teacher can’t teach

About his old friends who'd stopped being boys
There was Harwitz E. Green, just turned thirty-three
His leather chair waits at the bank
And Sergeant Dow Jones, twenty-seven years old
Commanding his very own tank
But Lather still finds it a nice thing to do
To lie about nude in the sand
Drawing pictures of mountains that look like bumps
And thrashing the air with his hands
But wait, oh Lather's productive you know
He produces the finest of sound
Putting drumsticks on either side of his nose
Snorting the best licks in town
But that's all over...
Lather was thirty years old today
And Lather came foam from his tongue
He looked at me eyes wide and plainly said :
"" Is it true that I'm no longer young ? ""
And the children call him famous
What the old men call insane
And sometimes he's so nameless
That he hardly knows which game to play...
Which words to say...

And I should have let him go on... smiling... being wise...",en,Rock,joy,0.999639034

Like those other things on valentines,

In the wedding cake ?
You used to hold him right in your hand.

When I hear the silly things that you say.

Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where ? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why ? I don't know
Round here we always stand up straight
Round here something radiates
Maria came from nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like elvis
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house, takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding jesus
She knows she's more that just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same
Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here she's slipping through my hands
Sleeping children got to run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning
She says, ""it's only in my head. ""
She says, ""shhh... . i know it's only in my head. ""
But the girl on the car in the parking lot says :
""man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling. ""
Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

Round here I got lots of time
Round here we're never sent to bed early
Nobody makes us wait
Round here we stay up very very late",en,Rock,sadness,0.993401945

Made a CD and then he hit the block

Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone

Still riding chrome

With diamonds and pearls,
At your head and your feet;

To banish misfortune;

It may only be a wish away

Sometimes you reach what's realest by making believe
Unafraid, unashamed
There is joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you
Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after
No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through
To ever ever after

Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin' on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin' on yo face)
(Verse 1:)
Hey yo Funke, pack your bags once again, it's on
Off on the road again, more like home
Now make sure you pack a bag with the cappa rats
And a head full of freestyles to prove it ain't a whack
We're headin' to the venues across the nation
Due to last album's underground sensation
Survive with the vibe what you feel inside
Is it real ? (It's real !) well then let it ride
With the funk, still got that funk, always got the funk 'cause I know it's what ya want, um I
Speak to my peeps with the beats from the streets
I guess when on the road that's why they cling to our meats
The girls be jackin', the guys be watchin, but no it's not The Lords, it's the hype they're clockin'
Weave our Glocks with hip-hop, so watch as they
They know we don't care if they're ready or not
(Refrain)
(Verse 2:)
When I'm pink in the bird do ya know I rocka socka .. MCs
You know I'm not havin' it, my skills are well crafted
My bounce to the ounce, my bounce in the mattress
So catch me I'm leakin', and not when I'm thinkin', 'cuz when caught with thinkin', I can catch up yer sneakin'
So back to the deala, the Lord's a mag dealer and the rope is equipped with tips
To get familiar so I'm never neglectin' it even
Though it's hectic, it's something I love that's why I'm always struttin'
So I step to the comas, my pace is
Just to get away from those who press my luck
(Verse 3:)
Here's the back monkey let me get the microphone it's time to go again
Mr. Funkyman ? is on the bird again
That's right so have no fear
Lords of the Underground are here, put your hands in the air
And let me drop the microphone and kick the funky sound
I'm out to make you party like its 1999
Check it ass out, make it funky for ya
Step to the rear if you're hip to see the point
Jackson, underground, shit was full of action
Give them nothing but the facts and hear me keep ya satisfaction
I rock it till the mic gets hot, ready or not, let me show you what I got no stop
(Refrain)
(Verse 4:)
You just don't understand what it takes to make the Lords of the Under
How we're keepin' hope alive sometimes it makes me wonder
Where in the world did I ever get the courage
To step onstage and send the crowd into a rage
I say the rhythm comin' that's when I commence the rotten
When I move across the stage, it can look as if I'm plottin'
With my funk on, you put the funk on? I got to get my funk on. You gotta put your funk on
I never been one to be jealous of what another man has
I learn my own business and wash my own hands
I never call girls hoes and bitches when I'm rapping
'Cause I'd rather not talk about it, manage to survive without it
To tell the truth, I got to much on my mind
To waste my time just attack the women when I rhyme
Either way the Lord's house is gonna stack
This hour will be fat, remember we'll be back

And playin' inside of clubs, I'm never the one to cuff

Take the rubber off, there's more passion you could explore""

Zoned out because I've been gone with the wind
I've blown a lot of money on these headphones and micro
Nomad, running the roads, rocking shows, vocal recital
Just keep making sure they hear you rattling the rear view
Breaking speakers, flipping fuses, taking no else I refuse
I don't do it for the money just to look
Then my hustle turned a little to a lot, that's enough to buy them things
We always wanted for ourself and I just daydreamed of but
Bring it in the living room and set it right there
It's like we living in a dream and you wouldn't know if you seen it
Look in the window, wait just let me clean it
I'm feeling good, catch me in the south like
Rolling in a blacked out, outrunning the sunrise
I'm feeling good, devil on my hip
Angel by my side, man everything is alright
I'm feeling good
Man I'm feeling good
Living out here you can keep the pace if you just slow it down
To a crawl we creeping when we drive and we speeding
That don't mean we in a rush, we racing so button your buckle
And flow through these fields, coyotes and honey suckles
Trouble seems so far when you stay living in the present tense
Ain't watching no news or reading nothing bout no president
We obey the laws long as everybody's watching
Then we stop it, drop it, load it up, dress it and chop
I ain't gotta do what tookie, putting food up on my table  (1)
It's feeling good to be willing and able, I'm able
To stay on my grizzly, busy and grateful
And I stock a lot of lead for animals and hatefuls
I'm feeling good, catch me in the south like
Rolling in a blacked out, outrunning the sunrise

3885,Jurassic 5,Power in Numbers,2002,Thin Line (Ft. Nelly Furtado),9,"Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
Would love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls
We've been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect the thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Tryin not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship
An ongoing kinship, ""we"" was ""people"" to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent
We've been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect the thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time

I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not an expert on how relationships should work
But, from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, whatchu doin after this?)
Infatuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say ""what's up
I want ... just ... a touch""
We've been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
We've been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect the thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect the thin line
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't wanna be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the room
This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of devotion
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that
""We"" was ""people"" to begin with, but you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'm tryin to salvage a friendship
We've been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line

Stand by the beach
And let's get warm by the fire
I had started this camp
Because I had the desire to spread good vibes
And it changed lives
For the better, better
Know that I've been chasing at the same time
Sand in my toes
And my hands in the sky
I gaze upon the stars
And I simply reply
That with the same thing
That's what we think
But you don't gotta look nowhere near as far to reach me
Off of the shore and into the waves of the water
I spotted souls that were drowning
But didn't want to be bothered
It's just like watching a man
That's about to jump to his death
You gotta stop him from taking that last step
I spotted them by the buoy
Not knowing what they were doing
I jumped right in
Swam to them
And put them onto the move
Back at the beach
We warmed them up with the fire
And drown their sorrow with love
And waves of thoughts inspired

He was addicted to dope
When asked his worth
He couldn't give me a quote
Not 'cause he thought he was priceless
Just that his price was too low

And lift yourself from whatever you're under
'Cause you know you got a story to tell""

And she was swinging, she missed
She tried working so hard
That she was ready to quit

Her reply made me sick

That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'

I wonder if he let me fly it, but it's a long shot

New tits for the mistress

Each step is only the beginning
No breaks, just heartaches
Oh man, is anybody winning?
It's a long road
And it's hard as hell
Tell me what do you do to survive
When they draw first blood
That's just the start of it
Day and night
You gotta fight
To keep alive

Right outside your front door,I tell ya
Out where they'll kill ya,You could use a friend

When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?
It's been a while since I last dreamt
Barely remember what it's like to dream
Finding it hard to get to sleep, too stressed
And there ain't anyone to sing a lullaby to me
Pretend shit doesn't get to me
And I suffer in silence when I'm hurting
A man's problems are his own
And it's my burden
Tossing and turning, trying to get to sleep
But I find it hard to switch off when my mind's working
I ponder on things I shouldn't ponder on
Off the rails, my train of thought's wandering
Sick of pretending to be so happy
All the while my anxiety's away at me
My skin crawling, I look up to the sky
And it falls, the walls close in and it's
As if all the good in my life disappears
In an instant, that thing is just so distant
So seeing the ones who I love, the ones who love me
But I don't wanna tell em how I feel in case they judge me
It's just me, wish I could let somebody in
But I ain't ever been too trusting
All the time I have layed in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?
Ohh oh oh oh...
I've barely had any sleep when I get up
Sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors
Like it's only when I'm in heaven that I sleep better
Might sleep better when I get up, I'm weak
It just makes my day harder, I wonder if
It would've been any different if I had a father that I knew
Could it have helped shape the way that I grew?
But the point of things I never have went from
Being a reason for the things that I do
To just being an excuse that I'd use
I've gotta take responsibility for the things I do
Find something other than negativity for my fuel
But I feed off it, even when I don't seem bothered
I hide everything that's going on inside
Guess it's been a while since I've been honest, I need help
But I deny it and even lie to myself like I'm fine
All the time I have layed in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye
Can you sing me a last lullaby?
I just wish someone would tell me it would be OK
But pessimism leads me to believe that it won't
To see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness
Is hard and depression is a slippery slope
I don't wanna do what my dad did with a rope, though
So I carry on even though it's hard to
The only thing that's definite is death and things always change
As long as you give em a chance to
All the time I have layed in your love
When your love kept me safe through the night
All the time I was sure you were mine
And before time demands our goodbye

Oh no, no, no they didn't, cause these ain't bars, these prisons
Walk with me, every step that I take in these Visvims
Real rare breed, cut from the cloth like
A phoenix feather when I write, Molotov, yikes !
You seen them flowers bloom, know that they grew in despair
A blessing in disguise, nobody knew it was there
My crown had been made, I just had to put it on
Now I spread my wings and let the bird of dawning sing its song
And when my grandpa died I broke down and cried
But still I am more than a man, I am a god
Sweetest is pain amongst all of the thriller things
I been through enough and so I need all of the iller things
One of these days some simple soul will pick up the Book of God, read it, and believe it.
Then the rest of us will be embarrassed.

So I wait here
Waiting for the light of the sun

I parted from the feeling, I was never gonna change
And I started to believe in the hope of better days
Then the wind changed in the garden
And the darkness went away

So I'll be almost to the ocean when you open your eyes
What's the point of California if we don't go to the beach?
What's the point of being friends when we're both so hard to reach?
What's the point of all the midnight text messages you send?
I can't help but break in half each time you ask me to bend
I can't help but unravel when you pull out a thread
I just lose my mind when you mess with my head
And I will always throw a tantrum if you throw me just some bone
I'm not your puppy, I'm a famous fish, who'd rather swim alone
You pulled me up to your bedroom

Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
Hey yo Stick, Stick
(Sticky)
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah. .
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah. .
Well it wasn't a good. . (What was it ? )
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What ? )
Yo, yo I dreamt I was white ! (Ohhh)
(Chorus : Eminem)
If he was white
What if he was white ?
What if he was white ?
What - If - He - Was - White ?
What if he was white ?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white ?
(Verse One : Sticky Fingaz)
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine ?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing ; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me
(Can I get your autograph ? )
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white I wouldn't of thought O. J. was innocent (He did it)
(Chorus : Eminem)
If I was white
What if he was white ?
What if he was white ? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)

(Verse Two : Sticky Fingaz)
If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm ? ) What shade would I be ?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class ?
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH !
In any case that be the ill shit right ? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad side of being white
You can't say the N word without startin a fight (What's up my nigger ? )
Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white plaque still have a ghetto shit (How you doing ? )
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true ! )
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)

What if he was white ? (What if he was white ? )
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white

What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (ummmmmmmm ? )
What if he was white ? (What if you were white ? )
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white ?
(What if he was white ? )
(Verse Three : Sticky Fingaz)
Yo, yo, yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I'd watch Tennis and Golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an Onyx, shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonix
Smokin on a marlboro instead of a Newport
Id live in Long Island instead of New York
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
Cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope ! )
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
Cuz all of the dreads would think I'm a cop
(Chorus : Eminem)

What if he was white ?
What if he was white ?
What - If - He - Was - White ? (Yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white ?
What if you were white ?
What if he was white ?
What - If - He - Was - White ?
What if he was white ?
What if he was

I'd been escaping the whole time
I had to finally look
Look at the mess we had made
And all that's lacker the glory
And tarnished failures
Stare at it... and then leave
I was too comfortable
Being comfortable is what kills artists
There is creativity for validation and there is creativity for survival
They're very different places
I didn't know what I wanted to say
Didn't know how the ink would stick to the page
How to let go of the anxiety
And the suffocating fear that latched onto my vocal chords
I had to figure out how to use my voice again
So we went ghost
The Irish goodbye (1), into the woods in the dead of winter
We bought a 1985 Suburban (2), loaded up our equipment
And just left town
People make music for all different reasons
It's the fabric that connects us
We dance together, we cry together
We celebrate our communities
We question our politics
We laugh, we scream, we imagine, we live
What I couldn't find in a hotel room on the road, or even in Seattle
I found in the middle of nowhere, no reception
Making music not because we had to, but because we got to
I had forgotten how to do that
Not being afraid of the platform we were standing on
Not creating from a place of ""Don't fuck it up""But creating from a place of ""Fuck it up""
Look at the mess
Not just the one that we created
But the one that is the very fabric of our country
The mess we're all living in
Stop being silent
Even if it's not perfect or politically correct, you have to speak up
You have to listen
Dance, cry, question everything
Laugh, scream, imagine, live
Music was never intended to be programmed to, manufactured and turned into a commodity
Music was intended to be that one thing that we could rely on to disrupt the norm
Start conversations and change the way that we think and we feel

See love ain't all heaven, and I am no angel

But all you got was me and that's all that I can be

Now it's no nice excuse but all the magic was used
Up on trying to uphold
Some kind of tame, flattering personal
That soon enough was getting real old
It takes more than pressure to change rock to diamond
Now all you have is sand,
Slipping through your fingers
You always wanted something more from my body
And said you needed something more from my loving
But all you got was me and that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down
But I'm not gonna sit around
And waste my precious divine energy
Trying to explain and being ashamed
Of things you think are wrong with me
I'm not gonna sit around
And waste my precious divine energy
Trying to explain and being ashamed
Of what you think is wrong with me
Set you up, you say I set you up
Like I was different than what I am offering you now
Let you down, you say I let you down
And drug your heart around
Did you forget about
All of the love and the acceptance that you promised me too?
You always wanted something more from my body
And said you needed something more from my loving
But all you got was me and that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down

Right through the center of town and

But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta tow the line, they want the water not the wine
But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt
Chances, people tell you not to take chances
When they tell you that there aren't any answers
And I was starting to agree
But I awoke suddenly in the path of a lightning bolt
Fortune, people talking all about fortune
Do you make it or does it just call you
In the blinking of an eye
Just another passerby in the path of a lightning bolt
Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta tow the line, they want the water not the wine

And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

5757,James Vincent McMorrow,We Don't Eat [Ep],2012,We Don't Eat,1,"If this is redemption, why do I bother at all
There's nothing to mention, and nothing has changed
Still I'd rather be working at something, than praying for the rain
So I wander on, till someone else is saved
I moved to the coast, under a mountain
Swam in the ocean, slept on my own
At dawn I would watch the sun cut ribbons through the bay
I'd remember all the things my mother wrote
That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust
Two thousand years, I've been in that water
Two thousand years, sunk like a stone
Desperately reaching for nets
That the fishermen have thrown
Trying to find, a little bit of hope
Me I was holding, all of my secrets soft and hid
Pages were folded, then there was nothing at all
So if in the future I might need myself a savior
I'll remember what was written on that wall
That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you, I'd have a little trust
Am I an honest man and true
Have I been good to you at all
Oh I'm so tired of playing these games
We'd just be running down
The same old lines, the same old stories of
Breathless trains and, worn down glories
Houses burning, worlds that turn on their own
That we don't eat until your father's at the table
We don't drink until the devil's turned to dust
Never once has any man I've met been able to love
So if I were you my friend, I'd learn to have just a little bit of trust",en,SingerSongwriter,sadness,0.866207838

With my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'Fighters keep fightin', put you lighters up, point them skyward, uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up still king
Rap game's nipple is mine for the milking'til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me, if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip dick you did opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell them shove it cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat flustered, lacked luster
Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it? Wasn't cause he had buzzards
Circling around his head waiting for him to drop dead, was it?Or was it cause some bitches wrote him off? Little hussy ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?What difference it make? What's it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage
And let be known from this day forward, I wanna just say thanks
Cause your hate is what gave me the strength

To tell Shady I love him, the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it

To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all bugging out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee hive
And how real is that? I remember signing my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

To be kicked down, forced to fight

Her attitude Rihanna, she get it from her mama
She jiggy like Madonna, but she trippy like Nirvana
Cause everything designer, her jeans is Helmut Lang
Shoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna Karan
Wearing all the Cartier frames
Jean Paul Gaultier cause they match with her persona
Her pistol go, her pistol go, I said her pistol go
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go, her pistol go, I said her pistol go
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
I see your Jil Sanders, Oliver Peoples
Costume National, your Ann Demeuelemeester
See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain
Goyard by the trunk, her Isabel Marant
I love your Linda Farrow, I adore your Dior
Your Damir Doma, Vena Cava from the store
I crush down with that top down, bossy see how I ride 'round
Miami in that Tom Ford, Papi in that Thom Browne
Rick Owens, Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall, that mean she shop 'til she drop
And Versace: got a lot, but she may never wear it
But she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents
Her pistol go, her pistol go, I said her pistol go
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go, her pistol go, I said her pistol go
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
Scoop back tees, breeze in the coupe
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together
Bags and links, jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together
You and me, me and you
Go away together, we could get away forever
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out
Her pistol go, her pistol go, I said her pistol go
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go, her pistol go, I said her pistol go
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga",en,Rap,anger,0.909014225

(Chorus:)We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge
Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?
I'm a lion cub, and I'm always getting licked (Meow!)
How's it going? I'm a cow (Moo!)
You drink milk from my tits (Moo)
I'm a fat, fucking pig
I'm a common fungus
I'm a disgruntled skunk, shoot you out my butthole
I'm a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up
And I'm Kanye West

We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home

Ba-dum-da-dum-dum, ba-dum-da-di
We are the vultures, feed on the dead
We're just some rhinos, horny as heck
I'm just a giraffe, what's with this neck?
Hippity-hop, I'm a kangaroo
I hop all day, up and down with you
I'm an elephant, I got junk in my trunk
What the fuck? I'm a clam!
I'm a wolf. Howl!
I'm a squirrel, lookin' for my next nut
And I'm a pony, just a freak horse, heh-heh-heh
But, uh, c'mon, get on (Yah)

I'm HPV, don't let me in
I'm a koala and I sleep all the time
So what? It's cute
We love you, India
We love you, Africa
We love the Chinese
We forgive you, Germany

Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick's (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)

We're not making music for aliens here
Are we gonna die?

I'm not going to lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out here who don't think Global Warming's a real thing. You know? We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid
Unless we get our shit together now 
Guys, everybody look into whatever the fuck Leonardo Di
Caprio is always pushing, ‘cause I feel like that guy knows more about… the Earth and how we’re fuckin’ it up than… anybody!
If the aliens do come, we should definitely send Leo as our guy, our rep.In fact, the profits that come along with the streams and the sale of this song are going right into the Earth.
Let’s raise some money for charity.
Any words, Leo?
This might be my favorite song ever. It’s awesome.
Wow. Thanks, Leo.

I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
Long ago I was a little girl yeah I was never ever able to fit in
My teachers at school would try to tell me what to do but, yo I would never listen
'Cause I was high all the time, stoned out of my little fucking mind
Misunderstood, lost and confused looking for a sign
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
I never knew what I should do so I just walked away and said ""Fuck off and die""
They said that I'm weird, that I'm ugly, and that I suck
I knew that one day all of those kids would grow up to be boring as fuck
I am a alien

Always on that next shit

Sometimes it feels like coming from this planet people are so sick and twisted

That your life would be over if I found another mate,
You call me up on the phone, we were talking til we fell asleep,
Without you I think I'd rather be in hell
Life just wouldn't be as fun, it wouldn't be the same,
I wanna stay with you forever and even take your last name
'cause there's no one in my life that makes me feel as good as you

With all the little jokes that no one else could ever know, and the part of me
That you can see 'cause you're the one I show
I know we gotta make it work, 'cause baby you're the man for me
Without you by my side my world would be incomplete
And if you ever leave me lonely, boy my heart would be crushed

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Someday I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Verse 1 – B.o.B:
Ever thought about losing it?
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent
And the grass so green on the other sid
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act 
And the clothes we bought, how much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
Cause if life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking!
What's the pattern for the madness
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of yours
(Chorus - Taylor Swift)
Verse 2 – B.o.B:
I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, yeah, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that've molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
Hey but if it's all for one, and one for all

Getting ready for bed at a regular time

David has probably never stopped to think what a wonderful thing sleep is
Dreams are normal too
Going to bed at a regular time each night
Makes it easier to go right off to sleep
Rest your head, here's a lullaby
A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare
Fast asleep, it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Craven my revenge from the shallow grave
Where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened
When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep
I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living' the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
Fell in love with hate 'cause evil fit like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man
But sickening now and fed by fear
The beast has been awakened now
They all think it's just pretend
You'll never ever sleep again
All your friends are fucking dead
You can't turn down your own deathbed

Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:
Peebe, peebe, who's Peabo Bryson?
Two years ago I renewed my licence
Anyway, why'd I start my verse like dat?
You can suck on a dick, or you can suck on a ballsack
No no, I don't endorse that, pause dat, abort dat
Just the other day mi go London, saw dat
Kids down the street, paparazzi, all dat
Hey hey what can I say?
Day day day da-day day
Coming through the club, all the girls in the back of me
This ain't football, why the fuck they tryna tackle me? Really?
I pick dude at the bar, like really
Looking like he wanna good time, like really
Said he had a friend for my home girl Lilly Lilly, Lilly, Lilly
(Chorus 1)
Nicki Minaj:
Day day day da-day day

Where my girls at uhh, hmm, uhh
Yo, where my girls at uhh, hmm, uhh
Yo, where my girls tryna get to jumpin'

Is calling somebody else baby

You see this scar here on my chest
I’m hurting and he don’t even care
It’s 4 AM and my lover won’t answer

Pour me up a drink I swear i need it

About to hurt somebody
Swear this man is begging me to leave him

Asking what things you have seen

Following things that aren’t right
And they’re tired and they need to be led
But you’ll scream and wait till you’re dead

Let it always be known that I was who I am
Beaten battered cold
My children will live just to grow old
But if I sit here and weep 
I’ll be blown over by the slightest of breeze 
And the weak need to be led
And the tender are carried to their bed
And it’s a cold and pale affair
And I’ll be dammed if I’ll be found there
But give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am
It’s funny that the first chords that you come to
Are the minor notes that come to serenade you
And it’s hard to accept yourself as someone you don’t desire

Mathematics is a difficult thing
I never understood what was the missing link
And by the time I calculated the correct solution
The question had escaped me and so did the conclusion
So tell me everything must always equal two
Or nothing else is true
And I'll believe you
Cos your X is equal to my Y
But equations pass me by
So will you take just a little of my mind and subtract it from my soul
Add a fraction of your half and you'll see it makes me whole
Multiply it by the times that we've never been apart
You'll see nothing can divide just a heart plus a heart
A little of my mind
Take it from my soul
A fraction of your half
See it makes me whole
And multiply the times
Never be apart
Cos nothing can divide a heart plus a heart
Don't know my Fibonacci or Pythagoras
But the only formula I know will work for us is that
When we're together in the sum of our parts
It's far greater than what we added up to at the start
So tell me everything must always equal two
Or nothing else is true
And I'll believe you
Cos your X is equal to my Y
But equations pass me by
So will you take just a little of my mind and subtract it from my soul
Add a fraction of your half and you'll see it makes me whole
Multiply it by the times that we've never been apart
You'll see nothing can divide just a heart plus a heart
A little of my mind
Take it from my soul
A fraction of your half
See it makes me whole
And multiply the times
Never be apart
Cos nothing can divide a heart plus a heart
A heart plus a heart
Take just a little of my mind and subtract it from my soul
Add a fraction of your half and you'll see it makes me whole
Multiply it by the times that we've never been apart
You'll see nothing can divide just a heart plus a heart

And takes away

And I will lift my hands
For You are who You are
No matter where I am
And every tear I’ve cried
You hold in Your hand
You never left my side
And though my heart is torn
I will praise You in this storm
I remember when
I stumbled in the wind
You heard my cry to you
And you raised me up again
My strength is almost gone
How can I carry on
If I can’t find You

Figuring which club to sneak in
Fancy drinks and fifty dollar cover charge
Lately it's been a big hassle
Heineken and new castle
To make sure he's fitting in and living large
Disregard the lies that he will tell and what he's probably like
Cause it's not hard his charm is gonna get him through the night
If he wants to rock he rocks
If he wants to roll he rolls
He can roll with the punches long as he feels like he's in control
If he wants to stay he stays
If he wants to go he goes
He doesn't care how he gets there long as he gets somewhere he knows
See her heavy makeup and cut t-shirt
Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already why adjust
Reading the magazine secrets
Forgetting the topical regrets
Cause if she comes home all alone the night's a bust
Si elle rentre à la maison tout seul, les nuits est un raté
It's a must the swivel in her hips and the look she gives
C'est un doit avoir en se dehanchant et l'apprarence qu'elle donne
It's all her trust if only in the morning she knew where she lived
Ce toute sa confiance si seulement le matin elle savait où elle habitait

Si elle veut danser elle danse

And in a wink they're on the brink
Et en un clin d'oeil ils sont sur le point
From drink to drink and at the bar with cash to blow
De poison à boison et au bar avec le pognion pour le flamber
Shot to shot it's getting hot
Deux à deux, ça devient hot
Advance the plot to see how far it's gonna go
Avance le terrain pour voir jusqu'à quelle distance ça va

Tout depend alors degote toi des amis et saisi un taxi

We gonn' do it again.
I promise we gonn' do it again.

Diamonds in my Shwayze chain.

They start showin' them fangs
Tryin' to take a ride on

What the hell am I to do ?
I got a girl in every city
From here to Peru.
When I left you,
I signed my name on your left boob
Now go get that tattoed,

Don't cry, I'll bust you
With a text soon.

Be back next June.

I hope you dance
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean taking chances, but they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth making

Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance

I hope you dance

I hope you dance
(Tell me who wants to look back on their youth and wonder)
I hope you dance
(Where those years have gone)
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

And your tired eyes refuse to close and sleep in your defense

If your heart wears thin I will hold you up
And I will hide you when it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
I'll be right beside you
When you're overwhelmed and you've lost your breath
Whenthe space between the things you know is blurry nonetheless
When you try to speak but you make no sound
And the words you want are out of reach but they've never been so loud
If your heart wears thin I will hold you up
And I will hide you when it gets too much

Don't pull away

I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping raiser, I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreaming bout the mic and the money and the ladies,
Oh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'm gonna stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement feathered bird
And if you didn't hear, then fuck whatever's heard
I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'ma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I dont like you, I just dont want to speak
You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live, cause God loves ugly

Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage, who is it ?
My name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other, so they can steal each other's sound
If it's all about getting down, when they get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down ?
Appears more clear in it's simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest
Measurin the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid,
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float on top the flood holdin' on to my ugly

Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say : Are you married ?
We'll say : No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not
Let us die young or let us live forever

Turn our golden faces to the sun
Praising our leaders, getting in tune

So many songs that we forgot to play,
So many dreams swinging out of the blue,

And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea

For restless eyes egos burn
And the mold is hard to break

And love is overboard

Fade like footprints in the sand

Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate

And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate

Or a cop gets knocked down
Black lives, not now, everybody matter to me
All races, y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases  (1)
Everybody hate somebody, guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protest with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart, why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around
Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground

You feel me?
We keep pushing
You ever stand on the edge like you had it up to here?
Wanna give up the drinking but fuck it you grab a couple beers
Wanna relax but end up relapsing and that is just severe
Ready to snap a call back to actions and grab your fucking hair
Really what happened is actually people that become your peers
Ended up stabbing you back to back now you're back to nothing near
Maybe the fact of the matter is that they are mad you're fucking here
If I give up there's dissatisfaction so add another year
Status what they see, that is what they fear
The strato-sph-ph-phere
Rapping with they N9na, have us left to spear
Trapping plus I'm here, I'm talking mental health
It's that who's fuckin' with it
Your pineal gland the frequencies you haven't just appear
Niggas play off that and women too
I had to love assure, look at them cut off
Crying shame, had to chuck the tears
I'm just giving facts, off the top
Stab is what you hear
Bar strike a chord like a sword, that's a musketeer
Sad enough the industry's holding me back because I'm here
Even the people that don't even know be noticing that so just be clear
Say don't help me smiling in my face and laugh at the premiere
Act is what appears until I go and grab a gun, come here
Sleep is coming back, stomach feel the acid up in there
They want me to die, that was with some air
Friends turnin' on me, people I'm supposed to rap with just been weird
My son needs his dad
Never will he say daddy wasn't there, muh'fucka
All I ever did was show love, so there's some things I don't get
(Woah!)These devils working overtime homie, they don't wanna let Iso live
(So!)I'm knocking on the door of success, one day I'ma slide on in
(Yo!)When the whole damn world go against me
I'ma scream out I won't quit
(No!)
(Chorus:)Tell 'em I won't quit
They tell you end your life, I won't quit (I won't quit)
They saying fuck your goals, I won't quit
And they ain't gotta say it, I won't quit
'Cause I already know, I won't quit
'Cause when they think you done, I won't quit (I won't quit)
You got to let them know, I won't quit
Just when they think they've won, I won't quit
It's like the further I get the more murderous hits just thoughts occurring again I'm certain to get too sore
Now hurt what I meant is your
Not surfing but when they lurking to get ya boy
But you're gonna get annoyed 'cause we're gonna win
I urge you to quit, you're going to get merked and then destroyed
The nerve of you bitches serve as a bigger ploy
I'm urging 'em with the noise that's earning me tips
I'm permanent with this 'noid
Nervousness shit, hits will get deployed
Never will I be the one to be giving up anything nigga if it's a choice
They gonna have to come murder me, simply takin' me, strikin' then strip my voice
I don't know why people try to hold me back
Been to hell so many times, I promise I ain't going back
Did so many favors, where my homies at?
Some owe me racks
I pull up bussin' doing donuts all up in your cul-de-sac
Homegirls turning into groupies, tell that hoe relax
I can't trust a single soul in case no one has noticed that
Got enemies in the industry and in the streets I want to clap
Done made my ass a maniac, man shout out to the brodie Kash
They making the mentally disturbed question if we matter
So should I stand over your grave with a weak bladder?
I should've been paid, they know that I eat rappers
And hating niggas can eat lead, delete backwards
Once I get a machine behind me, I'll wreak havoc
And pull the rug from under you niggas that bring static
So when you see Iso wilding like he's spazzing
Because everybody's trying to stop him and he's had it, muh'fucka
All I ever did was show love, so there's some things I don't get
(Woah!)These devils working overtime homie, they don't wanna let Iso live
(So!)I'm knocking on the door of success, one day I'ma slide on in
(Yo!)When the whole damn world go against me
I'ma scream out I won't quit
(No!)
(Chorus)
I been a blessing but Tech is looked at like I'm devilish by some
But I was beckoned in Heaven to the Earth on a curse better lick my dung
They don't want to step into death and be hurt, reverse never does my tongue
We the best in this effin', be wordy careful I get my gun
And that is your therapy
Calling click clack is your clarity
And rap is a rarity, when N9ne is rapping numerically
One for the evil and two for the people that's running with 'em like he's such a messiah
The three and the four and the fever at the non-believers
Split 'em like a fuckin' papaya
The kings in this bitch
KC to Nebraska, we blast at pity bastards, no esteem in this shit
The theme in this hit
Is about me and Iso what they dream in this script
By the one with a mic go write so mean and it's lit
'Cause I'm on the other shit
They wanna fuck a bitch
I wanna trip with the money then get with the homies and having enough to split
They got to bust a clique
Sick of 'em tryin' to be us, it's such a trip
When they be telling me they wanna get with the family they better suck a dick
Real spill with a psycho
Is when you keep rapping and little happens, but you think it still might go
'Cause your homies say you got a tight flow
But that shit ain't nothing but a lot of huffin'
In fact you suckin' like lipo
I won't quit until the day I go
Four years more, me and Kali shoot as high as the sky yo
Then it's bye though
Know buddies I leave it to JL, Joey, CES, ¡Mayday!, Stevie, and Iso
All I ever did was show love, so there's some things I don't get
(Woah!)These devils working overtime homie, they don't wanna let Iso live
(So!)I'm knocking on the door of success, one day I'ma slide on in
(Yo!)When the whole damn world go against me

Of material thugs and mischief
Fearing Saint Nomi's wisdom

Jealous of their faithful heart-bond
And their dancing and their laughing
Made at last a league against them
To molest them and destroy them

Lest the evil spirits harm you

He has moved a little nearer

To the master of all song

Crystal brother of two spirits

Stood round the rainbow fire
Burning embers, hearts united

I'm just sayin you should be stayin, but I ain't trippin
I'm in love with my money baby that's how I'm livin
You know I got you on my mind like an edge up
But you just thank I'm in the streets chasin after some ass
Tryin to break that bread, I'm tryin to get that cake
But you complainin talkin 'bout you fin' to escape, baby what it do
[Chorus]
[Paul Wall]
I'm tryin to tell you 'bout your friends hatin
You got them insecure thoughts in your mind
You steady listenin to the gossip in the beauty shop
But all them jealous single females want what you got
They would do anythang to take yo' place
Cause everytime I come around they be givin me
That sex face
So why you worried about your jealous so-called friends
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
And all the while your jealous friends been in denial
I ain't askin much, lil' momma just keep it real

As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said
I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, Building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other cover ups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts them, wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom, but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so-and-so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I'ma part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful
And I believe in the people,Yeah

But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not a holy war, wheres that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side, 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts, ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash them down with diet soda, killin' off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today

I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few

It ain't legal hunting alligators down in the swamp, boy
Well everybody blamed his old man,
For makin' him mean as a snake,
When Amos Moses was a boy,
His daddy would use him for alligator bait.
Tie a rope around his neck, and throw him in the swamp,
Alligator bait in the Louisiana bayou

Lived a man named Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
They raised up a son who could eat up his weight in groceries,
Named him after a man of the cloth,
Called him Amos Moses
Well, the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he's got left cause an alligator bit him
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow
Well the sheriff caught wind that Amos
Was in the swamp huntin' alligator skins
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna getcha boy,
But he never come out again.

Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck.

And found her crying needlessly in middle of the day.
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing, she went away.

While she was there and all alone, the angels came.

Every heartache will fade away

So hold your head up and tell yourself that there's something more
And walk out that door,
Go find a new rose, don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge, put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down, keep on rememberin'

All right stop collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gain weight
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play

With the bass kicked in and the vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5. 0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say ""hi ! ""
Did you stop no I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a guage and Vanilla with a nine
Reading for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumpet to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast other DJs say ""Damn""
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while Shay revolves it

I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the King on the microphone so is Dr. J and Moses Malone

My favorite play is the alley oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go,
Cause it's Basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow,

I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King,
And number 33, my man Kareem,
Is the center on my starting team,

Just give 'em the ball, and then you talk up too,
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene,
And Ralph Sampson is really mean,
Bill Russell didn't take no junk,
And Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk,
Tell me, were you in the joint ? ,
The night Wilt scored 100 points,
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back,
And didn't give nobody, no kind of slack,
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team,
With moves that came right out of a dream,
Or when, Willis Reed stood so tall,

But the truth it lay upon me
Like the Mississippi River runs deeper on the coast
I don't know what happened
I was acting on my passion
Wearing latest fashions I wandered in the cold
Then it came upon me in a midnight dream
As honey offers gold
As a gambler I can't hide my debts, as a sinner, as a soul
Pardon me if I forget what I've already been told
You can't hold that against me man
I'm on revelation road
Fire and brimstone pave the way
Hold hands together everyday
Nothing left to do but pray and put your head in the sand
Sinners and the preachers at each other's throats
Which one is the bad news man
Which one clatters most
Screaming turns to salt and dust
Volume is not heard
Bible beaters rest your fists
Haters rest your ire
You're both too young to know you're mute
Unconscious to the choir
But I can't hold that against you man
We're on revelation road
Grab your little passbooks
A ticket gets you in
One Hail Mary does the trick forgived of all your sins
And when the show is over
You're where you started from
Collecting all the barbs you threw piled up to be disposed
Judgement comes and never tires
Forgotten is the code
Doing unto others is a farce, a laugh, a joke
Remember when the black veil falls
We all stand alone

And I'm known as such,
And this is a beat uh u can't touch,
I told you homeboy u can't touch this,
Yeah that's how we're livin',
And you know u can't touch this,
Look in my eyes man u can't touch this,
You know, let me bust the funky lyrics,
U can't touch this.
Fresh new kicks and pants,
You've got it like that now you know you wanna dance,
So move out of your seat,
And get a fly girl and catch this beat,
While it's rollin', hold on pump a little bit,
And let me know it's going on like that likes that,
Cold on a mission so pull on back,
Let 'em know that you're too much,
And this is a beat uh u can't touch,
Yo I told you u can't touch this,
Why you standing there, man u can't touch this,
Yo sound the bells school is in sucker,
U can't touch this.
Give me a song or rhythm,
Making 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em,
Now they know when you talk about the Hammer,
You talk about a show that's hyped and tight,
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a mic,
Or a tape to learn what it's gonna take,
And now he's gonna burn,
The charts legit either work hard,
Or you might as well quit,
That's word because you know,
U can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh) (x2),
Break it down (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (x2),
Stop, Hammer time,
Go with the flow in a spin if you can't move
To this.
Then you, probably, are dead,
So wave your hands in the air,
Bust throught the moves run your fingers through
Your hair.
This is it for a winner,
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner,
Move slide your rump,
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump,
Bump bump bump yeah,
U can't touch this,
Look man, u can't touch this,
You'll probably get hyped, boy,
'cause you know you can't u can't, touch this,
Ring the bell school's back in, break it down,
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (x2),
Stop Hammer time,
(Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh) (x8)
Stop Hammer time,
Every time you see me that Hammer's just so hype,
I'm doped on the floor and I'm magic on the mic,
Now why would I ever stop doing this ?
With others makin' records that just don't hit,
I tournd around the world from London to the bank,
It's Hammer, go Hammer,
It's a Hammer you Hammer and the rest go and play.

And I was so pleased to be informed of this
That I ran twenty red lights in his honour,
Thank you Jesus, thank you lord
I had an arrangement to met a girl, 
and I was kind of late
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off,
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find
Much to my surprise there she was sittin' in a corner
Little bleary, worse for wear and tear
Was a girl with far away eyes
Well I tell you
So if you're down on, you're luck, and you can't harmonize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
Well
Well the preacher kept right on saying
That all I had to do was send ten dollars
To the church of the sacred bleeding heart of Jesus,
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
And all my dreams would come true
So I did, and next week I got a prayer for the girl
Well you know what kind of eyes she got,
Well I tell you
So if you're down on you're luck, I know you all sympathize
Find a girl with far away eyes

In your presence my memories swallow me
Moment for moment you throw me back
A new way, the same paths, old fears
I'm the tool of my demons
They hide the depths of my soul, in darkness

I'll battle you over the phone, you can call me collect""

Took a minute to exhibit that I'm sick with it""
""Have you any idea what I'll do to crews like you
How many niggas in my career I've ran through""
""At a thousand degrees Celsius, I make MC's melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself""
""Canibus is the type to fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life""
""While you niggas is babblin'
My lyrics is travelin' like a javelin to stab you in the abdomen""
""The intellectual athlete accurately rappin' so rapidly
Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically""
""I walk the B-Lock with the G-Lock, C-ocked
Tryna' get the DR-op on the C-ops""
""The Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin' to damage you spittin' understandable slang at you""
""Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs
And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns""
""Whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for 10 seconds""
""What's the matter with ya'll, I'll spatter ya'll
Against the muthafuckin' wall with these raw lyrics I catapult""

(Verse 1)
I'm hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores
To every single pore in my skull
Hard from my mouth to my jaws
From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored
And from my balls in my draws to the floor
I pray to God they hurry up and start the third World War
So I can start World War IV and murder us all
I don't give a fuck if you rich or you poor
Don't give a fuck if you got ya' picture in The Source or Forbes
I don't give a fuck who won an award
On stage tryna' thank God I'll chop they tongue off with a sword
Let they blood pour all on the floor
If it ain't a cordless, they gettin' punched in the jaw and hung wit' the cord
I'll leave they corpse stiff as a board
Like frozen meat tryna' thaw then bury em under the morgue
Gettin' in my way is like jumpin' in front of a car
Breakin' the sound barrier, that means the car is in front of the horn
By the time you hear it blowin', it's too late to respond
By the time you feel it hit you, I'm gone
I'll send ya' to hell where you belong
So by the time ya' body hits the floor
Ya' spirit won't be in it no more
Who could flow for 4 minutes or more
Without breaks, without mistakes, without flaws
I got millions of styles and I mastered em all
A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall
(Interlude)
""Whoever grabs the mic after me'll get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and ya' crew""
""I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I'll snatch ya crown with ya head still attached to it""
""I battle you for the respect, I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck""
""Ambushin' emcees, jumpin' out the trees like Vietnamese
In fatigues covered with leaves""
""Next year, you'll be walkin' around the ""How Can I Be Down""
Conference with a laminate, that said ""I Got Shitted-On By Canibus""""
""Turn ya' head round gimme the cheddar
I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever""
""Fuck ya'll, you don't impress me and no one can test me
An emcee so ill I got AIDS scared to catch me""
(Verse 2)
Canibus is what the hardcore niggas is waitin' on
Debatin' on, what the fuck is takin' so long
Well I'm here now, verbal ass whippin's bout to get shared out
Wack niggas bout to get aired out
Faggot niggas get they ass teared out
Grab a wise man by his goatee and rip his fuckin' beard out
Cold beat a nigga's ass like Stout
Then bust a shot in the muthafuckin' courtroom and watch it clear out
A hundred thousand mile warranty, metaphorically
I'll use a hundred thousand styles and murder you orally
I took a lion on tour wit' me, made him respect authority
Smacked him in the head for tryna' roar at me
Lyrics got my undivided loyalty
And there ain't nothin' on this God damn planet that's worth more to me
In the name of Hip-Hop niggas could corner me, torture me
Slice me then stitch me up like embroidery
Way back before gold-plated male and female
RCA jacks was used for crystal clear playback
I was tryna' blaze ADATS, and if a nigga said my demo was wack?
I'd beat his ass and took my tape back
""Yeah, nigga"" (smack) ""What? Yeah nigga take that""
Anybody get outta' line, get they face slapped quick fast
The Can-I-Bus'll buss yo' ass
Then I'll bust you wit' a shotgun blast
It's not fun so I don't laugh
To me this rap shit is as serious as, the death of a loved one
You know how you be feelin' sad
That's how I feel when I grab the microphone but niggas don't understand

It's time to say how much it meant

And convince me
I'm condescending

With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows
We're just the boys and girls that dance with all their clothes

Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows
All the suspense
That we've created
Now it's wasted
And we can't change it

How quickly lust can pretend it's love
Designing words to help us believe
It's so much more than just tonight

How quickly words can become our hands (you want it more, you want it more)
Resigning everything we believe (you want it more, you want it... )
You want it, you want it
More

When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
But time has no beginnings and history has no bounds
As to this verdant country they came from all around
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall
And they built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us all
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring(2)
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay
For they looked in the future and what did they see(1)
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land
All up through the seaports and into their hands
Look away said they across this mighty land
From the eastern shore to the western strand
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow

Behind the blue rockies the sun is declinin'
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done
So over the mountains and over the plains
Into the muskeg and into the rain
Up the st. lawrence all the way to Gaspé
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town
A dollar a day and a place for my head
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead
Oh the song of the future has been sung
All the battles have been won
O'er the mountain tops we stand
All the world at our command
We have opened up the soil
With our teardrops and our toil
There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
And many are the dead men too silent to be real",en,Blues,sadness,0.804252386

Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand.
I move on to another day, to a whole new town with a whole new way.
Went to the porch to have a thought.
Got to the the door and again, I couldn't stop.

But you still got your words and you got your friends.
Walk along to another day.

I like the autumn but this place is getting old.
I pack up my belongings and I head to the coast.
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most.
The day's get longer and the nights smell green.
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave.
I like songs about drifters - books about the same.
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane.
Walked on off to another spot.
I still haven't got anywhere that I want.
Did I want love ? Did I need to know ?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow ?

Adding their breeze to the summer nights.
Outside, water like air was great.
I didn't know what I had that day.

How good it was when you were here

And here at the end, I find
Yes I do

And make it right like a first class flight

So polite you might make me your wife
I ain't right the way I'm livin my life
See how I am when you turn off the lights

I gotta lil twitch up in my spine
And if I let you go and feel on me
You gone have to play this one mo' time

Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
Fifteen cars & fifteen restless riders
Three conductors, twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbond odyssey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields,
Passing graves that have no name,
Freight yards full of old black men,
And the graveyards of old rusted automobiles.

Good mornin', ‘merica, how are you ?
Hey don't you know me, I'm your native son.
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done.
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle,
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman's porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all that they feel.

Night time on the City of New Orleans,
Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'
Thru the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea.
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
“the passengers will please refrain”
This train has got the disappearin' railroad blues.

They're the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us,
Doesn't keep me warm
[Chorus]
There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down and hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you ; life goes on
You keep carrin' that anger, it'll eat you inside
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore",en,Rock,sadness,0.999834418

I could be a footballer a rock singer
Or a big film star, yes I think that I would like
I would like that
To be rich and have a lot of fans
And lots of girls to prove that I'm a man
To be number one and loved by everyone
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends
They really dig me, man, and I dig them
But the money that I spend, it is like my fame, that it's quickly gone
No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool
No more reporters at my beck and call
No more cocaine, now it's only ground chalk
And I can't afford a taxi so I have to walk
Didn't I have a nice time ?
Wasn't it such a nice time
I can't remember if I had a nice time
I realize I should have stuck to my guns
You stood me out just like a bastard son
And I lost myself, and I know that it was wrong
And it cost me a lot
No more drinking cause now the club shuts down
And I'm out here on my arse with the rest of the clowns
I get really scared without my bodyguard
And I'm sitting all alone in my expensive yard

11169,Jean Grae,"Revolutionary, Vol. 2",2003,You Never Know,17,"She was on her way to becoming a college graduate
Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
Disciplined, intellectual beauty's what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought, she didn't mess with broke kids
The thug niggas always talking about, how they smoke kids
But the rich-sniff-coke kids got no play
""I'm not even interested"" is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way, gave up trying to get in it
It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
On the block, bitches was jealous, but wouldn't admit it
Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
'Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except Mc
Donald's and did-dick
Smoking weed with thoughts of envy, whenever they lit it
She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always trying to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab, they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure
(Hook - Jean Grae)Don't you know that, time waits for no man
Not fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find, a reason why
God came, between you and I
If I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, 'cause you never know
(Verse 2)Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
That I wasn't just another nigga trying to get in it
So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
I didn't have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday, I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
We talked about, power to the people and such
We spent more time together but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch, or even cop a feel
I was too interested, in keeping it real
Perfectly honest and complete, she would always call me ""carino"",
And never Technique, bought me a new book to read every 2 or 3 weeks
Forever changing the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her, I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me, to stop hangin' out on the streets
To stop robbin' and stealin', from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
We sailed del Barrio and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day, to tell her my feelings was true
I couldn't live without her so I told her, facing my fears
But honey's only response, was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holding me tight
I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night
(Hook)
(Verse 3)I went on with my life, college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole, when my exit was near
At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole in the summer
came back, in tact and on track
But the fact of the matter, is I still felt cold
Even after my mother, hugged me, cryin' at home
My real niggas would catch me thinkin', out of my zone
Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone
Relatively well-known around the New York underground
But I kept thinking of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
I had to do something, because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds (are) still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin' cocaine
Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up, like a mother ought to
But her facial expression changed, when I asked about her daughter
(Hook)
(Verse 4)She told me that there was a note for me, that was left behind
She had left it there waiting, for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swelling up in her eye, and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was and I started thinking the worst
Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope with my name on the floor
""Nobody loves you more than me carino"" is what the letter said
""By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
But when you left in '97 a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me, to see what true love really does
'Cause even though we never made love, you were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought, you made me want to believe
And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby don't you see, I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hoped the end exists for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that you'll meet me in paradise inevitably
No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me""
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishing that I was dead, instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel
And now you know why Technique, don't fucking fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent, and then beyond

So you circled the globe spent a year on the road
Without ever going home
More than a couple of days then you leave right away
Run to a girl you barely know
But you like how she sings
And you can't help but think
That there's something that she knows and could teach you
Well, you're sleeping in that southern state where the the bars are filled with
People you can't hate
But try as you try and you still can't relate to them
You drink that whiskey down as they ask you
Are you who you say you are ?
Are you who you say that you are ? (x4)
The fact that we can't tell makes us like you even more
So you're trying again or just visiting friends
One had just had his heart broke
For the first time in his life he realized there's times
When you can't make it alone
But now you're giving advices as if you had the right
To use a word like love
It's a negotiable term, what gets said's not what is heard
So it's different then for everyone
But you keep hanging around that college town
With your new life, your new lover you found
And you are keeping her up at night
Bringing her down
She'll watch you drink yourself to death
But won't ask you
Is this really what you want ?
(x4)
Or are you just sticking with it now
Cause it's all you got ?
(x2)
I think you're sticking with me now
Cause I'm all you got...",en,Rock,sadness,0.999886274

I had a firecracker waiting to blow
Breakin' like a rocket who makin' its way
To the cities of Mexico
Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A
I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th
Had myself a lover who was finer than gold
But I've broken up and busted up since
And love don't play any games with me
Anymore like she did before
The world won't wait, so I better shake
That thing right out there through the door
Hell, I still love you, New York
Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds
Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good
Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place
When I was drunk and I was thinking of you
Every day the children they were singing their tune
Out on the streets and you could hear from inside
Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd
I would wait for you and I'd try to hide
And love won't play any games with you
Anymore if you don't want it to
The world won't wait and I watched you shake
But honey, I don't blame you
Hell, I still love you, New York
Hell, I still love you, New York
New York
I remember Christmas in the blistering cold
In a church on the upper west side
Babe, You stood there singing, I was holding your arm
You were holding my trust like a child
Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B
But I tried to keep the overhead low
Farewell to the city and the love of my life
At least we left before we had to go
And love won't play any games with you
Anymore if you want 'em to

Climb the endless shadow side
Watched him holding on

It was a thousand years, a thousand miles, a thousand dreams, a thousand minutes
With no goodbye
Disappear from me (a thousand miles, a thousand dreams, a thousand minutes)
Hold on !
As he climbed the highest peak of the dark mountain
Let the mountain sleep
In the past with all our bad dreams
Was it a metaphor for all the subtle ways we would grow apart ?
Was it mortality ?
Climbing and plunged right off of the edge of his life !
Into the hands of a loving God, oh reaching forward to get torn apart
With his hands in the air, was he laughing and dancing or only just trying to wave Goodbye' !
Say a prayer for me (Hold on ! )
As he climbed the highest peak of the dark mountain
Let the mountain fall
Struck me down until I can't go on
Let go ! Let me fall down ! onto ! the ground

Go on alone

That you never ever loved me

One song to sing

The way you judge a man is to look into his soul
And you'll soon see everything.
A voice from the past cried give peace a chance.
He paid our price now he's free at last
And imagine we called him a dreamer.
How many times must good men die ?
How many tears will the children cry ?
Till we suffer no more sadness
Stop the madness,
Oh stop the madness.
If ashes are ashes and dust is dust
And our journey's end and then we turn to rust
To the sands of the shore
White doves then fly
Peace to all
Tell me why the peacemakers fall
Must we bury anymore
A hush in the crowd as the horse rode by
Black lace veil hid the tears from her eyes
And we all wept in silence

How many times will the children cry ?

A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help, my mother made a man of me
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
Cause we was alone, and me I bought an F home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
And keepin' me ain't no big deal
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the money's low
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
She just prayin' for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
My baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
And sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I don't want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
Because these years he'll remember most
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?""
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta cope
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
Now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I feel ya...
Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
Because we livin' in a concentration set
And everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin we can't run from
So I know my number's comin' up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother Quanell's tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin to take another brother's shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the story's all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
Because she left my partner's family with memories
And after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?

That my heart would find someone like you
You see me, the real me
No in betweens, I had nowhere to hide
You took away the walls around me
Made me feel safe to share my truth

Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you
You hold me like a prayer, you touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
I do believe we're meant to be
Our chemistry will last forever
And through the years
We'll see some tears
We'll conquer fears
And together we will grow

I no longer have to be alone

Show me how you feel

I don't want to know the lover at my door

You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
Ooooh Oooooh Oooooh Ooooh
Now it's hard for me
When my heart's still on the mend
Open up to me
Like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me
And it's harmony
Girl what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything just to get you back again
Why can't we just try ?

What if I was good to you ?
What if you were good to me ?
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me ?

What if we were symphonies ?
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you ?

I'm going straight to hell
To burn in flames with the devil
Fuck the Church and that Christian shit
My tombstone's carved with a six six 6
I don't care about the lies that you preach
Alive to live, not to believe
In a god that i cannot see
After death
Enter life
In the grave
To never wake
After death
Enter life
In the grave
Into the dark
As flesh turns and rots
The blood in my veins doth clot
Ill be smiling as i decompose
As the rats eat my skin and bone
No escape when death comes to call
Inside my skull maggots still crawl
From the coffin your world looks so small
The reaper awaits us all
This is the deathklaat
After death
Enter life
In the grave

Sliding down my back

And I'm about to crack

The full moon behind a veil
The ocean crashing in my head
Outside the sirens wail
Jet black is my dirty hair
Jet black my heart and car
My lips are red, my skin snow white
My face is battle scarred

No longer feel my love

Maybe I don't need to know whats really love
Cause when he's around he's got me feeling some kinda way
I guess I kind of notioce he don't always act so kindly
But that doesn't stop my hunger, hunger for his heart
Why should I listen to thoes, who think that I should move on
Maybe what they see as drama, I see more as art

Cant seem to get past how he makes me feel
May not be love but it feels so real
Can't go with what they say must follow my heart

Maybe this is as good as it gets
Do I have faith in my confidence

It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin
What is game who got game
Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game
I got game
She's got game
We got game
They got game
He got game
It might feel good
Or sound a little somethin
But fuck the game if it ain't saying nothin

If man is the father the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe
Then why is this verse coming six times rehearsed
I don't freestyle much but write 'em like such (word)
Amongst times controlled by the screen
What does it all mean all this shit I'm seeing
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Sign of the local nigga unravelling
My wonderin' got ass wonderin'
Where Christ is in all this crisis
Hating satan never knew what nice is
Check the paper while I bet on ices
Keep more than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense preserves prayers laced with fear
Beware the two triple o is near
(Stephen Stills)
There is something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Tellin' me I got to beware
It's time to stop children what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
(Chuck D)
Thought of that millenium just be killing them
It scary like lies buried in a library
When did state pen correct anything
When piles of us still be catchin' the bus
When stacks of cash packed in laundramats
Pay the preachers back where the teachers at
I ain't even gotta ask it
Whose underpaid and got fouled at the basket
I can't blame the envy at who be getting all the benjis
And taking them grants for granted
Last I checked pyramids wasn't built like projects
On them government checks
Modern day thugs ain't got no guts
Pardon the expression under governor nuts
Last time in a church be the last time in a church
Dead pledge allegiance to cd's and movies
Leaving reality believing in fantasy
Bleeding fatalaties too many formalities
Prayers laced with fear
Beware the two trip zero is here

She taught him how to dance.
And when the melody through the window called
It echoed in the courtyard and whispered in the halls
He played it through the night, she knew he had to go.
There was something about freedom
He thought he didn't know.
And though their love was hangin' on a limb
She taught him how to dance and start again.
And though their love was hangin' on a limb
She taught him how to dance.
Though the river flows gently to the sea
He was on the shore, rooted like a tree
She was here and there, riding on the waves
Through it all, she heard his call
And gave it all she gave.
And though their love was hangin' on a limb
She taught him how to dance.",en,Rock,fear,0.979323983

Lived and played with my brother
How I wished that I could have saved him

He'd be here with me today
But then, I remember...
It happened anyway
When I look at pictures
And imagine what he would be like
Now a dozen years old
I wish I could have saved him from agelessness
If crying could bring him back
He'd be here with me today

It happened anyway
When I think of why and how
He was with us and left us
I wished I could have prevented it
And stopped his death, and saved him from
Never needing breath for birthday candles...

Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option
Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them ?
Don't listen to them suckas when they say you too irrational.
See I said I was king and them lames started laughing
Saying sucker now I want the king on the track

Watchu know like top back, dope boys,
Bring em out, and what you know about that
Now they ask how I talk what you know about that
Dominated '06, now Im going right back
See me reign hell, lettem show me like that
Even Denzel'll say damn, I ain't know it like that
Nigga yea, still bankhead you can tell
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail
Still kicking doors with them thangs in the air
Open Benny Honda, see me slang in dem chair
I will slang cane, no such thang as a jail
Said you need a hundred squares they just came off the scale

Stacks tall-ass ball playa from the stage to the air

I suggest you adjust the bass, except for when it going down

Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro & Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be

That makes me know that, we we we we're doin
We had the right idea in the beginning
And, and we just need to maintain our focus, and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times, and everything y'know
And and so. . y'know
The rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated
But it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved
"" The real... hip-hop ""
"" MCing, and DJing. . from your own mind, ya know ? ""
"" I... I guess right now we should start the show ""
[ First verse performed by Guru ]
Who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this... so many people
Searching for false lift, I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez...

"" You know my steez "" [ Method Man ]
"" Let ' em know, do your thing y'all ""... "" Keep it live ""
"" To the beat y'all "" [ Flavor Flav ]
[ Second verse performed by Guru ]
The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie ?
Yo... they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort

On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick ?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong

Which Backstreet Boy I wanna impregnate ?
Dr. Dre said Slim Shady you a cutie (Uh huh)
I'll give you a deal let me up in that booty (OK ! )
Well since age 12 I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt (Yup)

I told him to take his pants off, hooked him up, he let me slide
I pinched his ass
He winked at me
He chased me around the desk
I told him come and get me
Walked in the strip club
Had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender
And I tried to feel his dick up
Extra-terestrial runnin over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screamin at me
Let's just be friends !
99% of my life I was lied to
I just found out my Mom screws more guys than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
She met Violent J I couldn't believe it when he slapped her
You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
And try to touch your hands

Stick your manhood between my cheeks (Yup)
Am I cumming or going
I can barely decide
I just drank a pint of semen
Dare me to drive ? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
Dre's butt is too sexy to hide
Take your pants off Dre I don't mind
Clothes rip like the incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk
I'll do any guy that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
Sometimes I sit and wish Dr. Dre had a set of tits
Get behind me Shady and grab me by my hips
If I do that then I can't kiss you on your lips

Alcohol and Christianity,
I know which one I prefer
We never went to church,
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
But it's hit me since you left us,
And it's so hard not to search.
If you were still about,
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now,
I just get a bit scared,
Every now,
Hope I made you proud.
On your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons,
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
You tidied your things into the bin,
The more poorly you grew,
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to.
You put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but...
People say I interrupt people with the same look.
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book.
I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do.
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew.
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
I miss you dad, but I've got nothing to remind me of you
I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away,
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight.
I never cared about God when life was sailin' in the calm,
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And for that if God exists I'd reckon he'd pay me regard,
Mum says me and you are the same from the start.
I guess then you did leave me something to remind me of you,
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you.
But you used to tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
'Cause I know that you'd be proud.
I got a good one for you dad,
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman,

I ain't seen the sun shine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you
While I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
Ouh
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin on you for a long time
Fueling up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same how have you been
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drag you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

Resting in the safety of their tomb
Sheltered by six feet of soil and rock
The spade is the key with which their gate we'll unlock
Why should they be resting so peacefully
When we're up above in pure misery
I don't care that they've already died
That's not enough to make me satisfied
So we wait till the stroke of the midnight hour
Then we'll unleas the darkest of power
Hell's gates will open a new judgment day
Now is the time that the dead will pay
Why should they be resting so peacefully
When we're up above in pure misery
I don't care that they've already died
That's not enough to make me satisfied
Waking the dead, waking the dead...
All rise !
Hell's gates open the earth trembles and shakes
Now their pardons are over they pray for their mistakes
Mausoleums firebombed now rage in flames
When the dead come out their bodies we'll maim
REFRAIN :Rob-Robbing their graves stealing their bones
Bang-Banging our heads to their screams and their moans
Fix-Fixing the wounds that even time cannot heal
Soon-Soon we will know how good it feels
This is not damnation or an act of God
Now the dead they rise ripping through the sod
Purgatory has to wait, but how can this be
The dead are free - the dead are free!
(REFRAIN)
Waking the dead - you said that it wouldn't be
Waking the dead - You said that we wouldn't see
Waking the dead - You said that it was a lie
Waking the dead - Now the dead stand before our own eyes
Silence is blaring the earth opens wide
History repeats, reburied they die
Darkness descends through nature's pores
They return to their sleep on earth's basement floor
Now they rest not so peacefully
As they've had a taste of our misery
I didn't care that they'd already died
That wasn't enough to make me satisfied
Return back to their tombs now they lay
This is no game for the novice to play
Repeat not a word lest ye be forewarned
The punishment of Hell's darkness and scorn
Repeat not a word of the sermon said
A prayer for the dead, don't play with the dead
Don't try to comprehend what's going on
You can't understand, please don't understand
Waking the dead - And we'll be
Waking the dead - All rise now
Waking the dead - We're gonna wake the dead
I said the words what have I done
I thought it cool, I thought it fun
The words I say they start to change
The syllables now rearranged
A language I can't comprehend
I shut my mouth it doesn't end
The bowels of nature open wide
I cannot move I cannot hide
I can't believe the things I see
The dead are free, the dead are free
I close my eyes and pray it's not real
Their presence close coldness I feel
What have I done Lord please forgive
Once they died, but now they live

Cast out the demons

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Verse One : Ice Cube
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if ya fuck with me
The police are gonna hafta come and get me
Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showin out
Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like Gumbo
Goin off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at yo ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK - 47 is the tool
Don't make me act the motherfuckin fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin niggaz out tha box, daily
Yo weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin
But when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton

[ MC Ren ] Whassup ?

Verse Two : MC Ren
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggaz don't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'
And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy muthafucker from tha street
Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthafucker that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, coz I'm the motherfuckin villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin
That's takin place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton...
Chorus :
[ City of Compton, City of Compton ]
[ Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...
Verse Three : Eazy - E
... straight outta Compton
Is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother
And make ya sista think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfuckin cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a nigga drivin
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rollin
Lookin for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless ! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot ? Fuck her !
You think I give a damn about a bitch ? I ain't a sucker !
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother

12130,Air Supply,[Single],1983,Making Love Out Of Nothing At All,," ""Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are streaming through the waves in your hair""
En résumé, la chanson est vraiment à l'image du clip.
I know just how to whisper and I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers and I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it and I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth and then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you and I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer and I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading and I know that time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything
I've got to tell you but I know I've got to give it a try
And I know the roads to riches and I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(X 6)
Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost and it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright
I've got to follow it, 'cause everything I know, well it's nothing till I give it to you
I can make the run or stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really want to see me crawl ?
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all

I bolt the door real tight

Or am I just paranoid
When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes
And find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy
Just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me
Of Psycho too much

But every time they tried I said, That's not it
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that

With your candy-ass name you're a candy-ass rapper
I'll smack you up, shut you off like the Clapper
Whoever said you was raw, son, they lied
I know that shit I spit on Dialated hurt your pride
Screamin' on a record how you wish I died
But you don't wanna see me on this physical side
You're just a big tough guy, tryin' to act hard

You ain't pullin' my card, you ain't ridin' the train

With your platinum blonde Caesar, you look like a ho

Talkin' shit for shock value, boy, you ain't real
Turned hard the day Dre gave you a record deal
You went and sold your soul for some mass appeal
Servin' up that hors d'oeuvre, kid, now eat this meal
Instead of worryin' about who you should be dissin'
You need to worry about who your wifey been kissin'
Or if you go to prison while you're doin' your bid
I'll look in on your lady and do things for your kid
Make her write you lots of letters about the things that we did
And send you pictures of me chillin' all up in your crib
That shit about Sway n' Tek ? That was a fib
First time you met me I showed you love in D. C.
But you were scared like a pussy with your eyes on the floor
While your crew showed me love outside the front door
Talkin' 'bout ""Yo, whassup, ain't you Whitey Ford ?
I love that song 'What It's Like' and that jam 'Praise the Lord'""

You might hang around some gangstas, but you ain't one
And you won't be slappin' me with no empty gun
Talkin' 'bout a fag but you a one in drag
And you can't keep your woman from goin' astray
Better run and check your kid for your DNA

Your so fly your so high
Everbody around you trying to figure out why
Your so cool you win all the time
Everywhere you go man you get alot of shine
Boy like a magnet better yet I have it
Everything you wear people say they got have it
From the sweat suit to the white tee to the Gucci
You can probably say people wanna get like me

and get behind closed doors man you hit the floor
and what they can't see is your on your knees
So the next time you get it just tell em

you look at her whip you say the whip tight
You look at her crib you thinkin she paid

but everything she got the girl's been given
She calls it a blessing but you call it living
When it comes to money she can be a hero
She writes them checks with a whole lot of zeros

It was late at night, and we'd been driving since noon
But if I'd known how that would sound to you
I would have stayed in your bed for the rest of my life
Just to prove I was right
That it's harder to be friends than lovers
And you shouldn't try to mix the two
'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
Then you know that the problem is you
And it's true that I stole your lighter
And it's also true that I lost the map
But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
I had to take your word on that
But if you'd known how that would sound to me
You would have taken it back
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Burned it up and thrown it away
You put in my hands a loaded gun
And then told me not to fire it
When you did the things you said were up to me
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up

But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag

In 4 minutes Imma lose her to some other man
4 no less no more
I'm desperate 'cause the clock's ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go
Who are these people I don't know in my house and they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside
What's the reason that I get this feelin' that you can't keep it real with me
Is it cause of the prime relationships I had off in the streets ?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking and you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience
You're my last lifeline
I'm down to my last second

There's got to be a reason
And we know the reason why
You try to put on those hairs
And act real cool
But you got to realize
That you're acting like fools
If there's music, we can use it
Be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance
No romance for me, mom

When it turns from white to black
In my mind my thoughts fall
And I try to turn my back

I feel my heart beats too fast
I try to reach the thing I have to find
To push out this horrible beast
I see my enemy coming from inside
I've understood he lives in me
I have to kill myself to live
That's the way it should be
When I just turn my face
I can see his eyes up on me
The one thing I have to chase
Is the thought he's real to me

Hell is soft, I kept it real from the fuckin' start
I stay strapped, cause my neighborhood so dirty
I kiss my Grandma goodbye, but my jefa looks so worried

It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance.

Who cannot seem to give,

In the night when
The moon was in the yard.
He took her hand in his
And shook the long hair
From his neck and he told her
She'd been working much too hard.
It was true that ever since the day
Her crazy man had passed away
To the land of poet's pride,
She laughed and talked alot
With new people on the block
But always at evening time she cried.
And here's to the dawn of their days.
She moved her head
A little down on the bed
Until it rested softly on his knee.
And there she dropped her smile
And there she sighed awhile,
And told him all the sadness
Of those years that numbered three.
Well you know I think my fate's belated
Because of all the hours I waited
For the day when I'd no longer cry.
I get myself to work by eight
But oh, was I born too late,
And do you think I'll fail
At every single thing I try ?
And here's to the dawn of their days.
He just put his arm around her
And that's the way I found her
Eight months later to the day.
The lines of a smile erased
The tear tracks upon her face,
A smile could linger, even stay.

And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stain' strong,
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game,
Let's HOPE
[Chorus (Faith Evans]]
[Verse 3 (Twista)]
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic,
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it,
We can make it always so optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it,
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,
Why can't we kick it and just get em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King “Why can't we all just get along”,
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,
And ask why are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,
You can be wrong if it's you doubting,
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt,
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church !  !
And let's HOPE
[Chorus (Faith Evans] X2]

Yeah... My niggas...
Throw ya hands in the air right now man...
Feel this shit right here...
(Verse 1 - Fat Joe)I don't give a fuck 'bout your faulty mishappenin's,
Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,
Kids clappin' love to spark the place,
Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face,
It's a cold world, and this is ice,
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.
Got the Phantom in front building Trinity Ave.
10 years been legit they still figure me bad.
As a youngin', I was too much to cope with.
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit.
Should've been called Don robbery, extorsion or maybe Grand larceny...
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.
(Chorus:)Said my niggas don't dance,
We just pull up the pants and,
Do the Rockaway.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
See we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Rockaway.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

M to the whizz-Y
My arms stay breezy,
The Don's stay fizz-i,
Got a date, the day I was in the 740'fizz-i,
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die,
With a matchin' jacket,
Bout' to cop me a mansion,
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie,
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies.
Listen we don't pay admission,
And bouncers don't check us,
And we walk around the metal detectors.
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor,
Reckless ? , said it !
Like my necklace, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.
See, money ain't a thing nigga,
We still the same nigga, flows just changed
Now we 'bout to change the game nigga.

(Verse 3 - Fat Joe)Now we livin' better now,
Gucci sweater now,
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now,
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.
That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's.
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit,
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.
'Cause half these rappers dead broke like dirick fa' real.
If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,
These faggot niggas even made gang size commercials.
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up.
Can't keep tellin' me to talk about rucker,
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this,
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.

I'm sure I upset someone but my memory has chosen to omit it
A tiny voice telling me I really should cool it
Chewing my face off, talking absolute rubbish
The first line hit me like a kick in the face
I thought, ""I'd better have another one, just in case""
Next thing I knew, my heart was hunder attack
I bought a one way ticket to hell... and back

Bought a one way ticket to hell and back

But a coach-load of mutes would have been talkative chaps
If they had seen fit to join me for a couple of hits
Now my septum is in tatters and I've still got the runs
Burned for a moment, then it kicked like a mule
Several massive chocking lines of glorious gack
I bought a one way ticket to hell... and back

Stick it up your fucking nose !
Holding court, repeating myself, each repetition slightly louder
Pausing just long enough to snort the white powder
The wheels came off but I'm still on track

[Instrumental]
[II. Innocence]
I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow
Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more
But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might
In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same
Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near...
[III. Carpe Diem]
I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall
The sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall ticking away
""Seize the Day""
I heard him say
Life will not always be this way
Look around
Hear the sounds
Cherish your life while you're still around
We can learn from the past
But those days are gone
We can hope for the future
But there might not be one
The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned
Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, ""I Love You...
Good-bye""

So far or so it seems
All is lost with nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the T. V. screen
Another world where nothing's true
Tripping through the life fantastic
Lose a step and never get up
Left alone with a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up
I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see
I'm sick of all, you hypocrites
Holding me at bay
And I don't need your sympathy
To get me through the day
Seasons change and so can I
Hold on Boy, no time to cry
Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune

No !

The realist homies got you but you known them longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jelousy that you righteous
We prefare to keep our eyes shut to describe when
It's something wrong and we desire
So hold your head up high if you poor and righteous
Until time seems right
The problems seem endless
Put the time to this fairly we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're obligated then you need to get back in it
Coz nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsability one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the times when there was a ""the""
We got one push to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

It's the wrong way
Don't be afraid with the quickness you'll get laid
For your family get paid
It's the wrong way
I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her make-up
I never wanted

But I'm staring at her tits
It's the wrong way
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can
It's the wrong way
The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine until the day she met me
Annie are you sad, wanna shoot your dad
I'll do anything I can

We talk all night, try to make it right

Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner

Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way
